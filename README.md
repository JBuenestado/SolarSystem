# SolarSystem
Mandatory Problem #1, code and examples. Cpp

First of Mandatory Problems of FisCom

Code and examples of:
-Variations of Energy
-Variations in starting positions and velocity angles

Energy:
-It overall conserves itself while not changing masses of massive objects.
-If an object goes rogue, its energy increases.

Starting positions:
-Overall, the solar system is very stable, doesnt matter the starting conditions while we dont change their fundamentals (position out of their orbit )
-Mars has proven itself the most stable orbit, into extreme conditions all planets would go rogue and Mars would stay on its orbit.

Extra:
-Geocentric Model
